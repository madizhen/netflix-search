# netflix-search

There's been this paradox of individual choice and expansive databases that encourage overconsumption and can be overwhelming to the human mind. When you hear things like, Netflix had 6,494 movies and 1,609 TV shows*, it sounds attractive and like you'll never run out of things to watch--great! Except let's be honest, you aren't going to like everything they have. Do you ever feel like you spend more time looking for what to watch than actually watching something? This filter has two purposes

* A button that will automatically select a random title of a TV series or a movie, easy as that
..* The purpose of the button is to watch the first random thing that pops up, but keep clicking through if you *really* want, but that's just like a faster way of scrolling through. I leave it up to you.
* A filter that __only__ works for the genre of a TV or movie.
..* Anything listed as just <genre> is a series, while those that are movies are indicated <genre> Movie
  
Feel free to add any titles or delete ones that you think are awful. My methology is ~~lowkey~~ nothing. I try to keep it to a mix of things, so not just the well known titles that people have watched. Add some variety in the content, add somethings that people would normally glaze over. You might notice that some selections I already have up are sustainably focused. :heart::earth_asia:
